## üöÄ Getting Started

To get Whiz.it up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.x
* Node.js and npm (or yarn)
* Redis server installed and running
* Google Cloud Project with the Generative AI API enabled and API key configured
* Email service credentials for Flask-Mailman
### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd whiz.it
    ```

2.  **Set up the backend (ServerA):**
    ```bash
    cd serverA
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Configure environment variables for the backend:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `root` directory and configure the following environment variables:
    ```
    GOOGLE_API_KEY = ''
    # Database
    SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'sqlite:///quizmdb.db'

    # JWT
    JWT_SECRET_KEY = ''

    # Redis and Celery
    REDIS_URL = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'
    CELERY_BROKER_URL = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'
    CELERY_RESULT_BACKEND = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'

    # Caching
    CACHE_TYPE = 'redis'
    CACHE_REDIS_URL = 'redis://localhost:6379/0'
    CACHE_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT = 300

    # Mail
    MAIL_SERVER = 'your_mail_server.com' 
    MAIL_PORT = 587                     
    MAIL_USE_TLS = True                 
    MAIL_USERNAME = 'your_email@example.com'   
    MAIL_PASSWORD = ''
    MAIL_DEFAULT_SENDER = 'Whiz.it <noreply@example.com>' 
    ```
    **Note:** Make sure to replace the placeholder values (e.g., `your_mail_server.com`, email addresses, passwords, JWT secret key, and Google API key) with your actual configuration.

    

4.  **Run the Redis server:**
    Ensure your Redis server is running. You might need to start it in a separate terminal if it's not already running as a service.

    ```bash
    redis-server
    ```

5.  **Run the Celery worker and beat (from `serverA`):**
    Open two separate terminal windows in the `serverA` directory:
    ```bash
    celery -A run.celery worker -l info
    celery -A run.celery beat -l info
    ```
    *(Assuming you have initialized your Celery app instance as `celery` in your `run.py` file.)*

6.  **Run the Flask development server (from `serverA`):**
    ```bash
    python run.py
    ```
    The backend API will likely be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`.



7.  **Configure frontend environment variables:**
    Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory (if needed) to configure API endpoints (e.g., pointing to `http://localhost:5000`) or other environment-specific settings.
